% Description
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Compute the product of two multidimensional arrays.
% Only tensor_mult.m is needed.
%
% Note: If you need the result in a different order, use permute, see
%       example 4.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example 1
%
% C_{ac} = A_{ab} B_{bc}
%
% sum over second index of A and first index of B
%
% C = tensor_mult(A, B, 2, 1);
%
% This is equivalent to C = A * B
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example 2
%
% C_{bc} = A_{ab} B_{ac}
%
% sum over first index of A and first index of B
%
% C = tensor_mult(A, B, 1, 1);
%
% This is equivalent to C = A.' * B
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example 3
%
% C_{cedf} = A_{abce} B_{dfab}
%               1234     1234
%               ^^         ^^
%
% sum over first  index of A and third  index of B and
% sum over second index of A and fourth index of B
%
% C = tensor_mult(A, B, [1 2], [3 4]);
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example 4
%
% C_{decf} = A_{abce} B_{dfab}
%               1234     1234
%               ^^         ^^
%
% sum over first  index of A and third  index of B and
% sum over second index of A and fourth index of B
% reorder C_{cedf} -> C_{decf}
%
% C = permute(tensor_mult(A, B, [1 2], [3 4]), [3,2,1,4]);

% Example 5

%               1234     1234
%                ^ ^       ^^
% sum over the fourth index of A and third  index of B and
% sum over the second index of A and fourth index of B
